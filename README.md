Building a JavaScript Calculator using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript 
The calculator is built in an HTML 5 file using JavaScript at the bottom of the page to get the Event Handlers working for calculations,working our percentage and getting the Backspace and Clear Keys working.
The functions work off on-click events added into the buttons on the calculator 
Styling is done via an external CSS Style Sheet called style.css
